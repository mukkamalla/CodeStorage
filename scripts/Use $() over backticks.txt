Use $() over backticks
Avoid using backticks ““”, they are hard to read and in some fonts easily confused with single quotes. A lot of quoting needed in nesting.

Example:

$ echo "one-$(echo two-$(echo three-$(echo four)))"

1
one-two-three-four
$ echo "one-`echo two-\`echo three-\`\`echo four\`\`\``"

1
one-two-three-four
